## Background

### Our Expectations

● mlibc can support multiple embedded toolchains, including gcc (arm/risc-v) and even LLVM compilers.

● Designed for low-resource systems, providing excellent support for embedded real-time operating systems (such as RT-Thread) and bare metal.

● Optimized for RISC-V 32/64, compatible with mainstream RISC-V MCUs.

● Uses make and scons for building.

● Reserve

## Our Plans

● Use QEMU/RISC-V 32GC simulation to output the first "hello world" (completed).

● Add the basic crt.s, string, and printf functions for the bare-metal version of mlibc (completed).

● Improve mlibc based on this environment.

# Quick Start

## Mlibc Development/Test Environment Setup

### Running RT-Thread on QEMU

#### Development Environment

Tutorial for setting up the environment on Windows:

https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/blob/master/documentation/quick-start/quick_start_qemu/quick_start_qemu_windows.md

By following this tutorial, you can run RT-Thread in a Windows environment.

### vexpress-a9 + RT-Thread

#### Macro Configuration

  - DFS: device virtual file system
    - The version of DFS (DFS v1.0)

**Download the mlibc package:**

- RT-Thread online packages

#### Development Environment

For those unsure where to download the source code, you can refer to the above Windows environment setup tutorial.

Navigate to the `rt-thread\bsp\stm32\stm32f407-rt-spark` directory, then open **env** and enter **menuconfig** in the command line to enter the configuration interface.

#### Macro Configuration

**Enable the file system (optional):**

- Hardware Drivers Config
  - Onboard Peripheral Drivers
    - Enable File System

**Enable fatfs (optional):**

- RT-Thread Components
  - DFS: device virtual file system
    - Enable elm-chan fatfs
      - elm-chan's FatFs, Generic FAT Filesystem Module
      - Change Maximum sector size to be handled to 4096

**Download the mlibc package:**

- RT-Thread online packages
  - system packages
    - Select the sixth option from the bottom: mlibc: Embedded libc, especially for RISC-V

### QEMU-Bare Metal Development

#### Development Environment

> make + qemu + toolchain

Currently, five types of QEMU bare metal startup codes have been supported.

| QEMU Device                       | Hardware Architecture | Toolchain               |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| vexpress-a9                       | arm                   | arm-none-eabi-gcc       |
| mps3-an536 (requires latest QEMU) | arm                   | arm-none-eabi-gcc       |
| virt-aarch64                      | aarch64               | aarch64-unknown-elf-gcc |
| virt-riscv32                      | riscv32               | riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc |
| virt-riscv64                      | riscv64               | riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc |

#### Usage Steps

1. Configure the environment variables corresponding to the toolchain

**Linux：** Add the following environment variables to the `~/.bashrc` file through commands. Replace `YOUR_PATH_TO_TOOLCHAIN` with the corresponding path of your toolchain.

Note: If your toolchain path is "/opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10-2020-q4-major/arm-none-eabi-gcc" , then `YOUR_PATH_TO_TOOLCHAIN` should be "/opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10-2020-q4-major/arm-none-eabi-".
```
echo "" >> ~/.bashrc    #Append a a line break to prevent content merging
echo "export MLIBC_TOOLCHAIN='YOUR_PATH_TO_TOOLCHAIN'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Windows：** Open PowerShell and replace `YOUR_PATH_TO_TOOLCHAIN` with the corresponding path of your toolchain.
```
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("YOUR_PATH_TO_TOOLCHAIN", "YOUR_PATH_TO_TOOLCHAIN", "User")
```
**\#**:After the configuration is completed, you need to restart the terminal for the changes to take effect.

2. Navigate to the `mlibc/helloworld/qemu/{qemu-device}` folder and open the command line.

```
# Here, we use qemu-vexpress-a9 as an example
make QEMU_BOARD=qemu-vexpress-a9 ARCH=arm
```

After executing the command, an executable file named qemu-vexpress-a9.elf will be generated in the `mlibc/helloworld/qemu/qemu-vexpress-a9` folder.

3. Run the script `qemu.bat` in the corresponding folder.

```
# Enter the following command in the command line
qemu.bat
```

Information for each virtual environment is as follows:

| Filename          | Virtual Device | Switch Command                         |
| ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| qemu-vexpress-a9  | vexpress-a9    | make QEMU_BOARD=qemu-vexpress-a9 ARCH=arm  |
| qemu-mps3-an536   | mps3-an536     | make QEMU_BOARD=qemu-mps3-an536 ARCH=arm   |
| qemu-virt-aarch64 | virt-aarch64   | make QEMU_BOARD=qemu-virt-aarch64 ARCH=aarch64 |
| qemu-virt-riscv32 | virt-riscv32   | make QEMU_BOARD=qemu-virt-riscv32 ARCH=riscv32 |
| qemu-virt-riscv64 | virt-riscv64   | make QEMU_BOARD=qemu-virt-riscv64 ARCH=riscv64 |


## mlibc Library Compilation

#### Development Environment

For simple C library compilation, the development environment is relatively straightforward; make and the appropriate toolchain are sufficient.

> make + toolchain

#### Compilation Steps

1. Configure the environment variables corresponding to the toolchain
:Please refer to the detailed steps in the previous section)

**Compile the C library**

1. Navigate to the `mlibc` folder, open the command line, and use make to compile the static library.

```
# Here, we use the ARM architecture static library as an example
make mlibc ARCH=arm
```

2. A static library named `libmlibc.a` will be generated in the `mlibc/build/arm` directory. To integrate it with the toolchain, you can rename the file to `libc.a` for use.

**Compile crt0**

1. Navigate to the `mlibc` folder, open the command line, and use make to compile crt0.

```
# Here, we use the ARM architecture crt0 as an example
make crt0 ARCH=arm
```

2. The generated file will be located in `mlibc/build/$(ARCH)/crtobj`, named `crt0.o`.
